As was previously mentioned not to expect, keep distance and all so yes I am not doing that. But it is kind of like I will do those things that he likes. But deep inside I know I won't be able to withstand the person who is not at all caring. I still remember those words of his, all those articles that he asked me to read, and have mentioned there that he used to wait for someone to call rather than making his step first. Umm, I am a person who loves to be cared. The small gesture makes me happy Holding the door open at a coffee shop, holding onto the scooter until I get off, or pouring the rajma onto my plate and waiting until I've finished my food. Ah, I remember the second meeting. Once, ah the second meet. At Himalayan Java of krishna mandir, I wasnot even done with coffee ani la jam ray haha. He is ekdam weird. Tara ni wanna hold him. I mean hold him physically as like hug him right away not as if hold on to him over ever . He has just come out, I guess, out of his relationship. Tara his words push me away from thinking more than this, though I haven’t.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I used to be in love with complete certainty that it would never come to an end. I truly thought he was the one I'd marry — and for a while, it seemed like all the cards were falling into place to make it so. But things changed. Somewhere along the line, I discovered that it was not going to work, even with me still wanting their presence for some of the most difficult times — emotionally — especially when I was emotionally alone and needed them to have over as a support. And this is not entirely new to me. Earlier, there had been someone who cared about me so much — more than I could ever hope for. They would have done anything I wanted, questioningly, even if it was unnecessary or expensive. In hindsight, maybe I was drawn more to the things they offered than to whom they were. I loved, not maybe as much as they deserved. I never intended on hurting them — I lingered for as long as I was happy, for as long as the feelings seemed real. But happiness was fleeting, and the emotions soon wore off. But they were deeply fond of me. I wish with all my heart they move beyond this, that they fall deeply, truly, and reciprocally in love. I wish they find better — someone who chooses them each day. I find myself second-guessing at times, wondering if I was wrong to leave, if I somehow gave them hope that I could not uphold. But I was honest when we were there. I did not cheat, I did not lie — I just stopped feeling. And that, I could not help. I have a quiet guilt, not for how it ended, but for the weight of expectations that hung so far after I did. I simply wish to be me, without concession of what I am feeling. I didn't wish to fake it forever simply in case I was the one to leave. It pains me, yes — not because I betrayed them, but because I did love them, and yet still chose to leave. I merely wish that they realize sometimes love falls out without blame. And even in that ending, I wished them all the best. \n -Seemron</p>"
