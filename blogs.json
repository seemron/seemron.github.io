    "content": "<p>I am here at Pokhara doing nothing as if I have no work. But I donot have anything to hung into except his words. I have been so captivated by his words. As was previously mentioned not to expect, keep distance and all so yes I am not doing that. But it is kind of like I will do those things that he likes. But deep inside I know I won't be able to withstand the person who is not at all caring. I still remember those words of his, all those articles that he asked me to read, and have mentioned there that he used to wait for someone to call rather than making his step first. Umm, I am a person who loves to be cared. The small gesture makes me happy Holding the door open at a coffee shop, holding onto the scooter until I get off, or pouring the rajma onto my plate and waiting until I've finished my food. Ah, I remember the second meeting. Once, ah the second meet. At Himalayan Java of krishna mandir, I wasnot even done with coffee ani la jam ray haha. He is ekdam weird. Tara ni wanna hold him. I mean hold him physically as like hug him right away not as if hold on to him over ever . He has just come out, I guess, out of his relationship. Tara his words push me away from thinking more than this, though I haven’t.</p>"

What can be more precious for a man to be with a girl who is willing to be yours even without you asking her to be yours? Are you really afraid of those serious commitments or its just in between things where you want her for infinite intimacy and attention. Its not that you arent aware about how much she is into you and how much more will she do when she will know even you are in the same phase. I m ready to wait for you until you to be ready to be where you want to be . But I should atleast be assured that you are definitely going come one day.
