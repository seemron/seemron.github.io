                This page summarizes the research directions I want to pursue in graduate studies. The thread across all
                topics is the same: build reliable electronic systems that survive real-world noise, mobility, and scale.
                My current industry work in smartphone validation, prior RF optimization exposure, and embedded healthcare
                projects shape these directions.

                <summary>1) Cross-Layer Reliability for 4G/5G Smartphone Systems</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p><strong>Motivation.</strong> In device testing, many failures are not caused by a single layer in
                        isolation. Throughput collapse, call instability, battery drain, and thermal throttling often
                        emerge from interactions between modem behavior, OS scheduling, radio conditions, and application
                        load.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research Question.</strong> Can we identify low-cost runtime signals that predict impending
                        reliability failures before user-visible degradation occurs?</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Direction.</strong> Build cross-layer predictors using modem logs (registration,
                        handover, retransmissions), system telemetry (thermal, CPU/GPU load), and workload descriptors
                        from stress tests. Compare interpretable baselines and sequence models for failure forecasting
                        under mobility and interference.</p>
                    <p><strong>Evaluation Plan.</strong> Benchmark on controlled scenarios: call setup success,
                        handover stability, packet latency tails, and power-per-bit under 4G/5G transitions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potential Impact.</strong> Early-warning reliability models for smarter test automation and
                        more robust handset deployment.</p>

                <summary>2) Robust Remote ECG Monitoring Under Real-World Artifacts</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p><strong>Motivation.</strong> Low-cost ECG pipelines are highly sensitive to motion artifacts,
                        electrode variation, and wireless jitter. In practical telehealth settings, these issues dominate
                        performance more than nominal algorithm accuracy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research Question.</strong> How can a resource-constrained embedded pipeline preserve
                        diagnostic signal quality while minimizing communication and power overhead?</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Direction.</strong> Extend the AD8232 + ESP32 prototype toward a research-grade
                        stack with on-device signal quality indexing, adaptive denoising, event-triggered transmission, and
                        confidence-aware backend visualization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technical Focus.</strong> Joint optimization of analog front-end conditioning, digital
                        filtering, and communication policy to maximize reliable physiological insight per joule.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potential Impact.</strong> Deployable telehealth systems for low-resource settings with
                        measurable clinical utility and improved reliability.</p>

                <summary>3) Validation Science: From EVT/DVT/PVT Practice to Reproducible Research</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p><strong>Motivation.</strong> Validation workflows in industry produce rich evidence, but results are
                        often scenario-specific and difficult to generalize into reusable scientific methodology.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research Question.</strong> What test design principles make reliability claims reproducible
                        across software versions, hardware variants, and network conditions?</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Direction.</strong> Formalize a reliability testing framework with parameterized
                        stress profiles, failure taxonomies, and statistical reporting focused on tail risk instead of only
                        mean performance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Evaluation Plan.</strong> Use controlled replay across firmware revisions to measure defect
                        rediscovery rate, false pass rate, and confidence intervals for stability claims.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potential Impact.</strong> A bridge between industrial validation rigor and publishable
                        systems methodology.</p>

                <summary>4) Embedded Mobility Systems: Reliable Fare and Transit Intelligence</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p><strong>Motivation.</strong> Transit automation systems built on RFID, GPS, and mobile backends face
                        practical issues such as intermittent connectivity, spoofing risk, and noisy location estimates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research Question.</strong> How can low-cost embedded mobility platforms maintain accuracy
                        and trust under sparse infrastructure and unstable networks?</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Direction.</strong> Build fault-tolerant fare computation by combining map-aware
                        trajectory constraints, sensor consistency checks, and delayed-sync transaction logic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technical Focus.</strong> Secure device-to-cloud communication, edge-side validation, and
                        robust geospatial estimation for real-time public transit applications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potential Impact.</strong> Practical, scalable mobility systems with stronger reliability and
                        reduced fraud susceptibility.</p>

                <summary>5) Hardware-Software Co-Design for Resource-Constrained Intelligent Devices</summary>
                <div class="content">
                    <p><strong>Motivation.</strong> Real deployments require balancing sensing fidelity, compute budget,
                        thermal limits, and battery life. This is a co-design problem, not purely an algorithm problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>Research Question.</strong> Which partitioning strategies between firmware, edge inference,
                        and cloud processing maximize end-to-end utility in constrained embedded systems?</p>
                    <p><strong>Proposed Direction.</strong> Study design spaces for sampling strategy, feature extraction,
                        compression, and communication scheduling in microcontroller-based platforms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Evaluation Metrics.</strong> Accuracy under perturbation, latency, energy-per-task,
                        robustness to packet loss, and maintainability across firmware updates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Potential Impact.</strong> Generalizable design rules for dependable IoT and cyber-physical
                        systems in healthcare, mobility, and consumer devices.</p>

            <div class="subheaders">How I Hope to Collaborate with Faculty</div>
            <p class="aligned-text">
                I am particularly interested in research groups working at the intersection of embedded systems, wireless
                networks, dependable mobile computing, and biomedical instrumentation. I bring a measurement-first mindset
                from OPPO device validation, RF optimization experience from Huawei projects, and hands-on embedded
                prototyping from biomedical and transit systems. My goal is to contribute to rigorous, experiment-driven
                research that leads to both publications and deployable systems.
