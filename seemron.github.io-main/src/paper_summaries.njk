Low-Cost IoT-Enabled Tele-ECG Monitoring for Resource-Constrained Settings: System Design and Prototype</div>
            <details>
                <summary>
                   The authors present a low‑cost IoT tele‑ECG system for communities lacking healthcare infrastructure. By equipping operators (community health workers) with simple ECG sensors and Internet connectivity, the system transmits cardiac data to a central server. Doctors remotely review readings via a web interface, enabling early detection of cardiovascular issues without patient travel. The architecture emphasizes affordability, scalability, and rapid response to sudden deterioration, leveraging the IoT trend to reduce logistical and financial barriers. Though focused on design and a prototype rather than clinical validation, the work shows how remote monitoring can empower resource‑constrained populations and improve chronic‑disease outcomes.

                    <p>
                        Introduces the Transformer architecture, replacing recurrence and convolutions with self-attention.
                        This improves parallelization and enables strong sequence modeling performance.
                    </p>

                    <b>Method</b>
                    <p>
                        Uses stacked encoder and decoder blocks with multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers,
                        residual connections, layer normalization, and positional encodings.
                    </p>

                    <b>Results</b>
                    <p>
                        Achieves state-of-the-art translation quality at the time while training significantly faster
                        than prior recurrent models.
